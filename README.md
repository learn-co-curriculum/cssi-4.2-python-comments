#Python Comments

#Objectives:
+	Understand the importance of writing comments in programming
+ Know how to write comments in python

#Why Should You Care?
Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what something does in English, and they are used to disable parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily.

#Comments
We learned three ways to do comments in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.


In python, single line comments follow a '#'
```
>>>  # here's a comment
```
Comments can span multiple lines (more useful in a file than an interpreter):
```
# it is easy to
# write haiku in python with
# multi line comments
```
#Conclusion
Try adding a comment at the top of your practice.py file
